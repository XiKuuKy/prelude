* about
postlude is a fork of bbatsov's prelude, with less vanilla defaults using evil-mode.
** features
 + evil-mode by default
 + =SPC= and =Menu= leader keys
 + highly configurable (and meant to be fine tuned)
 + spotify support through =counsel-spotify=
 + ivy by default
 + org setup with fancy bullets (=org-bullets=)
 + no =super= key shortcuts so keyboard focused WMs work or for user's use
 + =general.el= inclusion

* thank you

Thank you to bbatsov for his wonderful prelude setup that I am building this on.
It's excellent and I highly recommend if you want to make your own emacs config
to start off his prelude and build from there.

* TODO goals
 [ ] Create more documentation
 [ ] Document existing modifications
 [ ] Polish README
 [X] Set README as default buffer
 [ ] Include =centaur tabs=
